How is nationalism constructed? Scholars have theorized the construction of the idea of nationalism in contrasting ways. While modernization theorists have emphasized nationalism as political projects engineered by political groups during “unsettled” times, others have emphasized nationalism as a practice that involves everyday people making meanings about the nation during settled times. Through a case study of the “814 expedition”, I found the type of nationalism demonstrated in the 814 expedition did not fall into this rigid dichotomy. By exploring the interactions between the state actors, national identity, and fandom culture, I argue for a relational understanding of nationalism. While fandom nationalism as demonstrated in the 814 expedition did not serve a political purpose but only acted as a confirmation of Chinese identity and expression of patriotism, the efforts of the state actors in capitalizing on the expedition’s nationalistic content underlies the entanglement between patriotic expressions as an affirmation of pride and Chinese identity versus conservative state-supporting nationalism.
