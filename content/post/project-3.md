title: "Predicting Student Attrition"
---
This case study uses four data sources. They are Financial Aid data, Static (demographic) data, and Progress data (which include student's GPA for each term), and finally a training set with studentID and labels of whether the student has dropped out. The goal of this case study is to use logistic regression, svm, and decision tree/ random forest to predict whehter or not a student will drop out and find a model with highest accuracy. In doing so, we can find out the best predicators that can explain student attrition. The dataset comes from Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
