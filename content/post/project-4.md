**Overview**  
swrm is a software start-up with the mission to help people live a more sustainable lifestyle using technology. The company has released an app in the app store. The app’s users are growing slowly and the company needed strategic recommendations on how to improve their existing app. 

**Goals**  
Initially, the cofounders wanted me to work on improving the existing app features. I provided a thorough heuristic analysis of the existing app using Nielsen’s 10 heuristic and pointed out several outstanding issues that needs to be fixed. But after having several meetings with swrm’s founders to understand their business’ value hypothesis, target customer base, I found that their previous research on value hypothesis validation asked many leading questions and was not rigorous. Since the app’s success depends on a valid value hypothesis, I recommended to the stakeholders the need to validate their value hypothesis first.

**Method**  
I used a mixed-method approach to test swrm’s value hypotheses. 

I designed an online survey using Google Forms to look at people’s sustainability habits and attitudes and used secondary research to break down the target population into two distinct segments with a screening question. I complemented the survey results with 10 in-depth 1:1 interviews to understand people’s motivation and desires in making transitions to a sustainable lifestyle and the problems that they may have encountered along that journey. 

**Impact**  
My research findings show that swrm’s value hypothesis was not in line with the problems their target consumers are having at the moment. I provided strategic recommendations on how they could pivot their consumer base so that they can find a market that is more profitable than what they have currently.
