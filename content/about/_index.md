I have a masters degree from the University of Chicago's MA Program in the Social Sciences. I have led mixed-method research project in my MA thesis with a combination of web scraping and online ethnography. Outside of academia, I have practiced lean start-up as a UX researcher and designed a customered-centered research project for a technology start-up in sustainability. I have also led a UX research project for an education non-profit with the goal to build better marketing outreach in countries outside of US. 

My grad school research experience taught me the scientific rigor of academic research. I endeavor to apply my research skills to help organizations and businesses to improve their products and services with an in-depth understanding of the problems, constraints, and business goals through empathizing with clients and end users. My academic research experience in the social sciences and my skills in data analysis allow me to bring a holistic approach to understanding user desires, needs, and behaviors. 

I enjoyed learning from projects and my colleagues. Outside of work, I enjoyed learning new recipes for cooking & practicing new songs on the piano.
